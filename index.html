          <p class="text">
            We are creating social media 3.0 with influencers, celebrities and
            creators being able to launch their own digital currency by simply
            creating a profile with media content posted as Non fungible Tokens
            that can be owned and traded on the Tknrs network

              <p>
                Creators can gain independence through a decentralised digital
                currency system that is dependent on growing and engaging with
                the community and also their star power. They own 10-15% of the
                total value of the tokens minted.

              <p>
                Holding social tokens allows the individual to gain access to
                benefits including unreleased content, private communities,
                direct access to celebrity, early- access to tickets and more as
                well as the ability to trade with other communities in order to
                gain access to more creator content with early token buyers
                being the biggest winners as the value of the token increases
                with more buyers.

              There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter,

              we would be actively engaging before we go viral.

              We would get them on our platform and they would see the
              opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their
              digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans
              can have the monetary value of their creator's currency increase
              significantly as they promote their digital currency across their
              channels while our native token holders benefit from the Weentar
              popularity.
